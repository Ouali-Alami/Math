# A number is divisble by three if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 
# For example 12345 = 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 then 1+5 = 6 then 6 is a single digit then 6 is divisible by 3
# this example make me feel there is an even faster way for the particulary case of the sum of the i from 0 to x, to dig....
# for this alogrithm to be useful you must imperatively convert the number into a string in order 
# to obtain each digit otherwise it is strictly useless
# the time complexity will be even worse because 
# you will apply the modulo on each of the numbers' digit
# we can apply the same algorithm for the divider 9

# A â‰¡ B [N] <=> B = A + N*K <=> B-A = N*K put another way N divide( B - A) K times
# another way to tell A//N and B//N have the same remainder in Euclidean division
# cool there is already a method that tell if a number is divisble by 3...
